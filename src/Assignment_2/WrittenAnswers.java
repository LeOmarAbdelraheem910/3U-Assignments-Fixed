//Question #1. Evaluate the following Boolean expressions for a Robot. Assume the robot is on intersection (1, 5) facing north. There is a Wall immediately in front of it. 
//In each case your answer will be either true or false.

//In each case your answer will be either true or false.

//a) True
//b) True
//c) False
//d) False
//e) False 
//f) Frue
//g) True

//Question #2. Consider the following if-else statements. Do they behave the same way or differently? Justify your answer.

//Both if-else statements behave in the same manner because they both code for the same command; however, the order of the statement is simply reverse. 
//Statement 1 asks karel in the if statement if it can pick up a thing. If it can it will turn right, and if it cannot it will turn left. 
//In statement two, the if statement asks if karel cannot pick up a thing. If it cannot, it will turn left and if it can it will turn right. 
//For the fact that the two statements code for the same thing, therefore they behave in the same way.
